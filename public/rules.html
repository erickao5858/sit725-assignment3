                                BANG! is a shootout game, in Spaghetti Western style, between a group of Outlaws and the Sheriff, who is their primary target. The Deputies incognitos help the Sheriff, but there is also a Renegade pursuing his own goal! In BANG! each player plays one of these roles, and represents a famous Wild West inspired character.

                                2. Play any number of cards <br> Now you may play cards to help yourself or hurt the other players, trying to eliminate them. You can only play cards during your turn <br> (exception: Missed! and Beer, see below). You are not forced to play cards during this phase. You can play any number of cards; there are only <b>three limitations:</b> <br>•	you can play only 1 BANG! card per turn; <br>•	you can have only 1 copy of any one card in play; (one card is a copy of another if they have the same name) <br>•	you can have only 1 weapon in play. (when you play a new weapon, discard the one you have in play) <br>Example. If you put a Barrel in play, you cannot play another one, since you would end up having two copies of the same card in front of you.

                                Brown-bordered cards <br>are played by putting them directly into the discard pile and applying the effect described with text or with symbols on the cards (illustrated in the next paragraphs).

                                Blue-bordered cards <br>are played face up in front of you (exception: Jail). Blue cards in front of you are hence defined to be “in play”. The effect of these cards lasts until they are discarded or removed somehow (e.g. through the play of a Cat Balou), or a special event occurs (e.g. in the case of Dynamite). There is no limit on the cards you can have in front of you provided that they do not share the same name.

                                3. Discard excess cards <br>Once the second phase is over (you do not want to or cannot play any more cards), then you must discard from your hand any cards exceeding your hand-size limit. Remember that your hand size limit, at the end of your turn, is equal to the number of bullets (i.e. life points) you currently have. Then it is the next player’s turn, in clockwise order.

                                Distance between players <br> The distance between two players is the minimum number of places between them, counting clockwise or counterclockwise (see figure). The distance is very important, because all cards with a sight take it into account. Normally you can reach only targets (players or cards) within a distance of 1 (note the of your Colt .45 on your playing board). When a character is eliminated, he is no longer counted when evaluating the distance: some players will get “closer” when someone is eliminated.

                                Eliminating a character<br> When you lose your last life point, you are eliminated and your game is over, unless you immediately play a Beer (see below). When you are eliminated from the game, show your role card and discard all the cards you have in hand and in play.

                                The game ends when one of the following conditions is met: <br>a) the Sheriff is killed. If the Renegade is the only one alive, then he wins. Otherwise, the Outlaws win; <br>b) all the Outlaws and the Renegade are killed. The Sheriff and his Deputies win.

                                Example 1. All the Outlaws are eliminated, but the Renegade is still in play. In this case, the game continues. The Renegade must now face the Sheriff and his Deputies alone.<br> Example 2. The Sheriff is killed, but all Outlaws are eliminated, and one Deputy and the Renegade are still in play. The game ends with the Outlaws winning! They achieved their goal at the cost of their own lives!
